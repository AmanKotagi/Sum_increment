# Roy Autosynthesys Architecture (4-bit)

**Welcome to the Verilog implementation of the Roy Autosynthesys architecture for 4-bit addition.**

This repository contains the following files:

### Core Components

* **Grey_Square.v:** Implements the Grey Square box, which represents the initial stage of the addition process.
* **White_Square.v:** Implements the White Square box, responsible for processing intermediate results.
* **White_Circle.v:** Implements the White Circle, which handles Sum propagation.
* **Grey_Circle.v:** Implements the Grey Circle, representing the final stage of the addition process.

### Top-Level Modules

* **Roy_Autosynthesys.v:** The top-level module that integrates the core components to perform 4-bit addition.
* **Roy_autosynthesys_tb.v:** A simple testbench for verifying the functionality of the top-level module.
* **Roy_autosynthesys_tb.vcd:** A Value Change Dump (VCD) file generated by the testbench, which can be analyzed using GTKWAVE to visualize the simulation results.
